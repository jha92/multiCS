## Multiple Coulomb Scattering of electrons in matter

F. Salvat, J.D. Martinez, R. Mayol, J. Parellada:
A Monte Carlo program to simulate the penetration and energy loss of keV
electrons through matter
Computer Physics Communications 42 (1986) 93â€”104
mcsda.f stored as AALC at the CPC program library in Belfast

translated into Fortran 90 and C++
- multics.f90  Fortran90
- multicspp.cpp  plain C++
- multics.cc with ROOT

## bugs fixed from mcsda.f

- CALL RMBRG( rngd, EC, E, D, 1D-6, 10, 6 ) ! 10 gets overwritten!

  SUBROUTINE RMBRG( fct, XL, XU, Y, EPS, NPART, IPRNT )      

  NPART = -NPART ! flag low accuracy

- NaN: bug in DIRECT
  U = AW*DSQRT( 1D0-V*V-W*W ) ! NaN

- DIRECT is wrong at small angles
  completely changed with proper rotation matrix

- Wentzel model needs AA1 but it is not assigned in case of IS = 0
